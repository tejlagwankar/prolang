1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators
###########################

You have numbers:
    3  # => 3

Math is what you would expect:
    1 + 1   # => 2
    8 - 1   # => 7
    10 * 2  # => 20
    35 / 5  # => 7.0

Integer division rounds down for both positive and negative numbers.
    5 // 3       # => 1
    -5 // 3      # => -2
    5.0 // 3.0   # => 1.0 # works on floats too
    -5.0 // 3.0  # => -2.0

The result of division is always a float:
    10.0 / 3  # => 3.3333333333333335

Modulo operation:
    7 % 3   # => 1
    # i % j have the same sign as j, unlike C
    -7 % 3  # => 2

Exponentiation (x**y, x to the yth power):
    2**3  # => 8

Enforce precedence with parentheses:
    1 + 3 * 2    # => 7
    (1 + 3) * 2  # => 8

Boolean values are primitives (Note: the capitalization):
    True   # => True
    False  # => False

negate with not:
    not True   # => False
    not False  # => True

Boolean Operators:
Note "and" and "or" are case-sensitive:
    True and False  # => False
    False or True   # => True

True and False are actually 1 and 0 but with different keywords:
    True + True # => 2
    True * 8    # => 8
    False - 5   # => -5

Comparison operators look at the numerical value of True and False:
    0 == False  # => True
    2 > True    # => True
    2 == True   # => False
    -5 != False # => True

None, 0, and empty strings/lists/dicts/tuples/sets all evaluate to False.
All other values are True:
    bool(0)     # => False
    bool("")    # => False
    bool([])    # => False
    bool({})    # => False
    bool(())    # => False
    bool(set()) # => False
    bool(4)     # => True
    bool(-6)    # => True

Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation,
but their non-cast value is returned. Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise
and/or (&,|)
    bool(0)     # => False
    bool(2)     # => True
    0 and 2     # => 0
    bool(-5)    # => True
    bool(2)     # => True
    -5 or 0     # => -5

Equality is ==:
    1 == 1  # => True
    2 == 1  # => False

Inequality is !=:
    1 != 1  # => False
    2 != 1  # => True

More comparisons:
    1 < 10  # => True
    1 > 10  # => False
    2 <= 2  # => True
    2 >= 2  # => True

Seeing whether a value is in a range:
    1 < 2 and 2 < 3  # => True
    2 < 3 and 3 < 2  # => False
    Chaining makes this look nicer
    1 < 2 < 3  # => True
    2 < 3 < 2  # => False

(is vs. ==) is checks if two variables refer to the same object, but == checks
if the objects pointed to have the same values.
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Point a at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
    b = a             # Point b at what a is pointing to
    b is a            # => True, a and b refer to the same object
    b == a            # => True, a's and b's objects are equal
    b = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Point b at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
    b is a            # => False, a and b do not refer to the same object
    b == a            # => True, a's and b's objects are equal

Strings are created with " or ':
    "This is a string."
    'This is also a string.'

Strings can be added too:
    "Hello " + "world!"  # => "Hello world!"
    String literals (but not variables) can be concatenated without using '+'
    "Hello " "world!"    # => "Hello world!"

A string can be treated like a list of characters:
    "Hello world!"[0]  # => 'H'

You can find the length of a string:
    len("This is a string")  # => 16

Since Python 3.6, you can use f-strings or formatted string literals.
    name = "Reiko"
    f"She said her name is {name}." # => "She said her name is Reiko"
    Any valid Python expression inside these braces is returned to the string.
    f"{name} is {len(name)} characters long." # => "Reiko is 5 characters long."

None is an object:
    None  # => None

Don't use the equality "==" symbol to compare objects to None
Use "is" instead. This checks for equality of object identity.
    "etc" is None  # => False
    None is None   # => True

    );
  }
}
